# CSS Resource Guide

One of the hardest parts about teaching yourself web development is knowing what resources to use. These are the guides, tutorials, and other sources that I found to be the most helpful for learning CSS from the beginner level.

## Beginner CSS Resources
[Free Hands-on Basic CSS Course - freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-css/): A basic course that walks you through the tools you have in your arsenal with CSS. Should be used in tandem with other resources.
<br>

[CSS Crash Course for Absolute Beginners - Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoY53QXEnI): Like the HTML crash course, this gives a wonderful overview of what you can do with CSS with solid examples and a fantastic teacher.
<br>

[Responsive Landing Page using HTML & CSS - Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJXXf3_dcng): My first landing page I ever built using a tutorial. Very modern and useful.
<br>

## Flexbox / Grid Rexources
[Floats, Flexbox, Grid? - Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7gqJkdc5dM): Explains the difference between using floats, flexbox, and grid.
<br>

[Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/): PLEASE use this before attempting to mess with flexbox. It's a cute little browser game that will save you hours of time.
<br>

[Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/): Made by the creators of Felxbox Froggy. Again, PLEASE use this before attempting to mess with grid.
