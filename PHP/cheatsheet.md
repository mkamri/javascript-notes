* PHP runs on the web server, meaning it is **not** viewed by the actual browser.\
* PHP variables always start with a `$`, both in defining them and using them.\
* PHP automatically converts value types when necessary, such as converting the string `"3"` to the number `3` when necessary. This is called *type juggling*.\
