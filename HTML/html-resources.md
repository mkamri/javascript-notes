# HTML Resource Guide

One of the hardest parts about teaching yourself web development is knowing what resources to use. These are the guides, tutorials, and other sources that I found to be the most helpful for learning HTML from the beginner level.

### Beginner HTML Resources
[Free Hands-on HTML course - freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/): A great course for beginners who want to know what tools they have to work with. This should be used in tandem with other resources.

[HTML Crash Course for Absolute Beginners - Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE): If you're more of an auditory learner, you might prefer YouTube tutorials over reading blocks of text to understand the basics. Brad Traversy is one of my favorite teachers, and he has a lot of free content on YouTube.

[8 principles for clean html code - The WebShala](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mveMwXsM94w): A simple two-minute video that explains concisely how to write clean, modern HTML code. This actually saved me quite a lot.
