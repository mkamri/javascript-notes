# HTML DOM Manipulation Resource Guide

One of the hardest parts about teaching yourself web development is knowing what resources to use. These are the guides, tutorials, and other sources that I found to be the most helpful for learning about the HTML DOM from the beginner level.

**Note: I'd recommend getting very comfortable with HTML/CSS and basic Vanilla JS before proceeding to this step.**

## General Resources

[Understanding the Document Object Model - Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/understanding-the-dom-document-object-model): This is by far my favorite resource for learning about the document object model. I followed all the tutorials and took quite a lot of notes, which can be found [here](./cheatsheets/dom-cheatsheet.md).

[JavaScript HTML DOM - W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp): Used this as a reference to understand DOM elements and methods as they came up in other tutorials.

## App Tutorials

[To-Do List App Tutorial - Code Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sUhU_eq3g): This is the first project I built using HTML DOM manipulation. He spends the first half of the video explaining what the plan for the code is, so don't be worried if you can't put it all together at first. I'd recommend getting very comfortable with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS before attempting this. You can find my notes on the project [here](./cheatsheets/to-do-cheatsheet).
