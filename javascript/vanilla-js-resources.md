# Vanilla JavaScript Resource Guide

One of the hardest parts about teaching yourself web development is knowing what resources to use. These are the guides, tutorials, and other sources that I found to be the most helpful for learning Vanilla JavaScript from the beginner level.
<br>
If you are an absolute beginner, please note that it's completely normal to feel like you're in over your head. Take frequent breaks, but make sure you're learning at least one new concept every single day to keep up the habit of coding. Take your time. I promise, the more you work with it, the less overwhelming it will become.

## Beginner Vanilla JavaScript Resources

[Introduction to Javascript - MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction): This is where I started my JavaScript journey. It's a great overview, and gives some real-world examples of how JS works. I'd recommend taking good notes and taking your time to understand how each line of code works, if this is your first taste of a programming language.
<br>

[Introduction to Javascript Course - Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript): This is where I'd say I learned the bulk of my Vanilla Javascript basics. I didn't want to shell out money for the paid portion of the course, but I found that the free section still had everything I needed to get started. I prefered freecodecamp.org for HTML/CSS, but for some reason the Codecademy JS course worked better for me.
<br>

[JavaScript Crash Course for Beginners - Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c): This is a fast-paced crash-course on JavaScript. I'd recommend spending some time on MDN or codecademy before watching this video, as it might be a lot of information at once. However, I still refer back to what I did in this video so it's worth your time when you're ready.
<br>

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/): This is hands down my favorite place to learn programming as a whole. Even if you only plan on using JavaScript for web development, I'd recommend training on codewars just to get your brain in a "programming" mode. I spent about a month doing codewars challenges as warm-ups, and I'd say they're the main reason I'm where I am today with JavaScript.
<br>

[The Coding Train - Youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw): This is my favorite youtuber to learn CONCEPTS about programming from. He's fun, excited, and engaging. When I have a question on how to use a particular method in JavaScript, I always check to see if he has a video first.

## DOM Manipulation Resources

[Understanding the Document Object Model - Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/understanding-the-dom-document-object-model): This is by far my favorite resource for learning about the document object model. I followed all the tutorials and took quite a lot of notes, which can be found [here](./cheatsheets/dom-cheatsheet.md).
<br>

[JavaScript HTML DOM - W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp): Used this as a reference to understand DOM elements and methods as they came up in other tutorials.
<br>

## Object Oriented Programming

[Explaining JS's Prototype Like You're Five - dev.to](https://dev.to/codesmith_staff/explain-javascripts-prototype-chain-like-im-five-51p): Description in the title. I've spent a good couple of hours trying to figure out the prototype chain, and this was the resource that finally did it for me.

## Asynchronous Coding
[Understanding JavaScript Callbacks - All Things JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nau-iEEgEoM): A great video explaining callbacks and their various forms and uses.

[What the heck is a callback? - Codeburst](https://codeburst.io/javascript-what-the-heck-is-a-callback-aba4da2deced): Explains callbacks in plain English with clear examples.

## Working with API's

[How to fix the CORS error - Medium](https://medium.com/@dtkatz/3-ways-to-fix-the-cors-error-and-how-access-control-allow-origin-works-d97d55946d9): I'm mostly just including this for my own reference. This is a great resource explaining the CORS error and how to fix it.
<br>

## App Tutorials

[To-Do List App Tutorial - Code Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sUhU_eq3g): This is the first project I built using HTML DOM manipulation. He spends the first half of the video explaining what the plan for the code is, so don't be worried if you can't put it all together at first. I'd recommend getting very comfortable with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS before attempting this. You can find my notes on the project [here](./cheatsheets/to-do-cheatsheet).
