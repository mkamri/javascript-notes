# Vanilla JavaScript Resource Guide

One of the hardest parts about teaching yourself web development is knowing what resources to use. These are the guides, tutorials, and other sources that I found to be the most helpful for learning Vanilla JavaScript from the beginner level.
<br>
If you are an absolute beginner, please note that it's completely normal to feel like you're in over your head. Take frequent breaks, but make sure you're learning at least one new concept every single day to keep up the habit of coding. Take your time. I promise, the more you work with it, the less overwhelming it will become.

## Beginner Vanilla JavaScript Resources

[Introduction to Javascript - MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction): This is where I started my JavaScript journey. It's a great overview, and gives some real-world examples of how JS works. I'd recommend taking good notes and taking your time to understand how each line of code works, if this is your first taste of a programming language.

[Introduction to Javascript Course - Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript): This is where I'd say I learned the bulk of my Vanilla Javascript basics. I didn't want to shell out money for the paid portion of the course, but I found that the free section still had everything I needed to get started. I prefered freecodecamp.org for HTML/CSS, but for some reason the Codecademy JS course worked better for me.

[JavaScript Crash Course for Beginners - Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c): This is a fast-paced crash-course on JavaScript. I'd recommend spending some time on MDN or codecademy before watching this video, as it might be a lot of information at once. However, I still refer back to what I did in this video so it's worth your time when you're ready.

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/): This is hands down my favorite place to learn programming as a whole. Even if you only plan on using JavaScript for web development, I'd recommend training on codewars just to get your brain in a "programming" mode. I spent about a month doing codewars challenges as warm-ups, and I'd say they're the main reason I'm where I am today with JavaScript.

[The Coding Train - Youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw): This is my favorite youtuber to learn CONCEPTS about programming from. He's fun, excited, and engaging. When I have a question on how to use a particular method in JavaScript, I always check to see if he has a video first.
